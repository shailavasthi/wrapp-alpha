# Wrapp

## Wrapp is a tool for efficient writing

Wrapp is designed with a hollistic writing process in mind. It's a tool for writers who want to take their ideas and turn them into polished final drafts as efficiently as possible, without sacrificing quality.

## Who is Wrapp for?

Wrapp was initially designed as a better way for students and researchers to write papers. However, it works just as well as a tool for writing articles, blog posts, or any similar kind of writing.

## How do I use Wrapp?

Wrapp takes your project through three phases: the Outline, the First Draft, and the Draft Editor. Each phase integrates with the next so that your writing process is cohesive. Each phase also comes with its own set of instructions so that you can focus on your writing. Wrapp also organizes your project into sections and allows you to edit them individually to make large projects more managable.

## Does Wrapp work on mobile?

Yes! While there are still some bugs on mobile, Wrapp is designed to be mobile-friendly, and all core features will work on your mobile device. Using Wrapp on mobile is a great way to write on the go.
